# BLE Guardian - BLE Tracker Detection App

BLE Guardian is a native Android application designed to detect and analyze nearby Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices to identify potential unauthorized trackers. It runs a background service to continuously scan for BLE devices, logs their proximity and location, and uses a sophisticated analysis engine to detect suspicious behavior, such as a device consistently following the user.

## Features

### Core BLE Detection
*   **Background BLE Scanning:** Runs a persistent background service to scan for BLE devices even when the app is not in the foreground.
*   **Device Logging:** Records all detected BLE devices, including their signal strength (RSSI), manufacturer, and the time and location of each detection.
*   **Emergency Scanning:** Tap-to-scan functionality for immediate BLE device detection.

### Advanced Device Management
*   **Smart Device List:** Comprehensive device list with multiple sorting options (last seen, first seen, name, signal strength, threat level).
*   **New Device Detection:** Visual indicators for devices discovered within the last 24 hours.
*   **Device Search & Filtering:** Search by name/address and filter to show only new devices.
*   **Device Labeling:** Custom labels for organizing and identifying specific devices.
*   **Device Tracking:** Mark devices for enhanced monitoring and analysis.

### Individual Device Analysis
*   **Detailed Device Profiles:** Complete device information including manufacturer, type, and detection statistics.
*   **Location History Timeline:** Full chronological history of where each device was detected.
*   **Threat Assessment:** Visual threat level indicators with detailed following scores and risk analysis.
*   **Detection Statistics:** Comprehensive analytics including average RSSI, signal variation, and movement patterns.

### Intelligent Threat Detection
*   **Advanced Following Detection:** Sophisticated analysis engine that calculates "following scores" based on:
    *   **Detection Frequency:** How often a device is detected.
    *   **Location Correlation:** Proximity of the device to the user over time.
    *   **Movement Similarity:** Compares the movement patterns of the device and the user.
    *   **Temporal Proximity:** How closely in time detections occur relative to the user's presence.
    *   **Multi-factor Analysis:** Combines multiple behavioral indicators for accurate threat assessment.
*   **Real-time Alerts:** Notifications when devices exhibit suspicious tracking behavior.
*   **Known Tracker Detection:** Identifies common tracker types (AirTags, SmartTags, etc.).

### Interactive Mapping
*   **Enhanced Map View:** Visualizes BLE device detections on an interactive map (powered by OpenStreetMap).
*   **Device-Map Synchronization:** Seamless navigation between device list and map locations.
*   **Location Focusing:** Jump directly to specific device locations on the map.
*   **Historical Tracking:** View movement patterns and detection history geographically.

### Data Management & Privacy
*   **Configurable Data Retention:** Customizable retention periods for detection data (1 week to 1 year).
*   **Automatic Data Cleanup:** Scheduled cleanup of old data to prevent database bloat.
*   **Manual Data Management:** On-demand database clearing and size monitoring.
*   **Privacy Controls:** Local data storage with user-controlled retention policies.

### Modern User Experience
*   **Material 3 Design:** Modern, intuitive interface following Google's latest design guidelines.
*   **Responsive Navigation:** Smooth transitions between screens with contextual actions.
*   **Real-time Updates:** Live scanning status and device information updates.
*   **Accessibility Features:** Designed for users with various accessibility needs.

## Building the Project

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mihaics/bleRadar.git
    ```
2.  **Open in Android Studio:**
    Open the project in the latest version of Android Studio.
3.  **Build the project:**
    Android Studio should automatically sync the Gradle files and download the required dependencies. Once the sync is complete, you can build the project by clicking `Build > Make Project`.
4.  **Run the app:**
    You can run the app on an Android emulator or a physical device. Note that BLE scanning requires a physical device with Bluetooth enabled.

### Build Commands
```bash
# Project validation (works without Android SDK)
./validate-project.sh

# Build with Android SDK
./gradlew build
./gradlew assembleDebug
./gradlew installDebug

# Run tests
./gradlew test
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

## Permissions
