# BLE Guardian - BLE Tracker Detection App

BLE Guardian is a native Android application designed to detect and analyze nearby Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices to identify potential unauthorized trackers. It runs a background service to continuously scan for BLE devices, logs their proximity and location, and uses a sophisticated analysis engine to detect suspicious behavior, such as a device consistently following the user.

## Features

### Core BLE Detection

*   **Device Logging:** Records all detected BLE devices, including their signal strength (RSSI), manufacturer, and the time and location of each detection.
*   **Emergency Scanning:** Tap-to-scan functionality for immediate BLE device detection.

### Advanced Device Management
*   **Smart Device List:** Comprehensive device list with multiple sorting options (last seen, first seen, name, signal strength, threat level).
*   **New Device Detection:** Visual indicators for devices discovered within the last 24 hours.
*   **Device Search & Filtering:** Search by name/address and filter to show only new devices.
*   **Device Labeling:** Custom labels for organizing and identifying specific devices.

*   **Threat Assessment:** Visual threat level indicators with detailed following scores and risk analysis.
*   **Detection Statistics:** Comprehensive analytics including average RSSI, signal variation, and movement patterns.

### Intelligent Threat Detection
*   **Advanced Following Detection:** Sophisticated analysis engine that calculates "following scores" based on:
    *   **Detection Frequency:** How often a device is detected.
    *   **Location Correlation:** Proximity of the device to the user over time.
    *   **Movement Similarity:** Compares the movement patterns of the device and the user.
    *   **Temporal Proximity:** How closely in time detections occur relative to the user's presence.
    *   **Multi-factor Analysis:** Combines multiple behavioral indicators for accurate threat assessment.
*   **Real-time Alerts:** Notifications when devices exhibit suspicious tracking behavior.
*   **Known Tracker Detection:** Identifies common tracker types (AirTags, SmartTags, etc.).

### Interactive Mapping
*   **Enhanced Map View:** Visualizes BLE device detections on an interactive map (powered by OpenStreetMap).
*   **Device-Map Synchronization:** Seamless navigation between device list and map locations.
*   **Location Focusing:** Jump directly to specific device locations on the map.
*   **Historical Tracking:** View movement patterns and detection history geographically.

### Data Management & Privacy
